# Coding for Food

## Prerequisites

Come to the session with a laptop (or other type of device suitable for software development) configured to support programming in the language of your choice, using the tools of your choice. Be (psychologically) prepared to allow others to use the machine, because the teams will move from one project to another in the course of the session.

## Round 1

1. Self-organize into teams of 2 or 3 people each.
2. Get your project assignment.
3. Use the documentation provided here to get started with development.
4. Work on the code during the time-boxed development period.
5. Share your results.
6. Vote on the results.
7. Receive edible rewards.

## Round 2

1. Self-organize into different teams. Try to work with people who were not on your Round 1 team (if feasible).
2. Go to a workstation other than the one you used in Round 1. Hopefully it will be feasible for everyone to work on a different project than they did in Round 1.
3. Continue development of the project that was started on this workstation during the time-boxed development period.
4. Share your results.
5. Vote on the results.
5. Cheerfully receive feedback from your colleagues and from the facilitator.
6. Receive edible rewards.
